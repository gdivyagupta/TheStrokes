# Abstract

This paper aims to examine and understand the formula behind the popularity of certain songs by The Strokes. This is done by examining the relationship between track popularity, lyrical explicitness, and track length duration using Spotify’s data available through its API. This analysis reveals that explicitness is not a strong indicator for song popularity, illustrated by a 28% presence of explicit lyrics in The Strokes’ top 50 most popular tracks. On the other hand, there is a positive correlation between the track length and track popularity. These findings are further illustrated via visual graphs.

# 1. Introduction

The Strokes are a critically acclaimed rock band that was formed in New York in 1998. Since the 90s, they have steadily gained popularity, with thought-invoking lyrics centering politics and philosophy—explored through globally acclaimed songs like *“Ize of the World”*, *“New York City Cops”*, and *“Last Nite”* throughout the 2000s. Spotify provides valuable metrics regarding their global popularity as well as specific information such as specific track popularities.

This paper aims to examine the “formula” behind a popular The Strokes song and examines various variables such as lyrical explicitness and track length to understand the recipe behind a popular song by the band. Inherently, the paper answers two research questions:
1. Does lyrical explicitness impact track popularity for The Strokes?
2. Is track duration a good predictor for track popularity for The Strokes?

Spotify’s Web API was used to analyze the top 50 most popular tracks by The Strokes. Further data was extrapolated regarding lyrical explicitness across their top 50 songs and its potential influence on track popularity. Since The Strokes are known for their brave lyricism as they combat politically charged and emotional topics in their songs, lyrical explicitness can be a relevant predictor for track popularity among their audience.

Further, we examined track length and its relation to track popularity. In a time of reduced attention spans and expansive access to music through platforms like Spotify and Apple Music, there is a race to make songs popular by tapping into the formula of shorter but catchier tunes [@giraldo_2020]. It is worth examining whether this formula stands true and works for The Strokes.

This paper is thus structured as follows: Section 2 explores the data set, measurement, and methodology, Section 3 visually displays the results, and Section 4 discusses the implications of our results and concludes the paper.

# 2. Data

The dataset was procured using Spotify’s Web API in tandem with the `spotifyr` package in R [@thompson_2022]. This gave us access to variables such as:

- **Name**: The name of the song.
- **Popularity**: A score (between 0-100) calculated via user engagement metrics on Spotify, illustrating the popularity of a certain track. Here, 100 is the most popular track while 0 shows low popularity.
- **Explicit**: A binary variable (`TRUE` or `FALSE`) indicating whether the song is explicit.
- **Duration_ms**: The length of the track in milliseconds.

The data was organized to extract The Strokes’ top 50 most popular tracks on Spotify. Then, they were analyzed for the distribution between explicit and non-explicit tracks as well as the distribution of popularity across tracks of various lengths. These analyses are further explored in the Results section. All scripts are available on GitHub.

## 2.1 Measurement

Three variables were analyzed during this study—popularity, explicitness, and duration.

- **Popularity**: Defined by Spotify using track play counts (a play counts if the track is played for at least one minute). This metric can be used to assess user interest in certain tracks.
- **Explicitness**: Tracked through Spotify’s `explicit` variable, which labels a track `TRUE` if it contains strong language, mature content, or inappropriate words.
- **Duration**: Measured in milliseconds by Spotify. For simplicity, the duration was converted to seconds as all The Strokes songs are at least one minute long.

# 3. Results

## 3.1 Explicitness and Popularity

In the top 50 most popular tracks, it was found that 28% of them are explicit. **Figure 1** illustrates the distribution of tracks by popularity along with their status as explicit or non-explicit. It can be seen that there is no strong correlation indicating that explicitness is a predictor for song popularity. Extremely popular songs such as *“Reptilia”* have no explicit lyrics, whereas other songs such as *“12:51”* and *“Ode to the Mets”* contain explicit lyrics and still chart very highly.

```{r}
# Select relevant columns: name, popularity, explicit
strokes_data <- strokes_track_details %>%
  select(name, popularity, explicit)

# Find the top 10 most popular tracks
top_tracks <- strokes_data %>%
  arrange(desc(popularity)) %>%
  slice_head(n = 50)  # Get the top 10 tracks

# Display the top 50 tracks
print(top_tracks)

# Count how many of the top tracks are explicit
explicit_count <- top_tracks %>%
  count(explicit)

# Display explicit vs. non-explicit counts
print(explicit_count)

# Plot: Popularity of top tracks and explicitness
ggplot(top_tracks, aes(x = reorder(name, -popularity), y = popularity, fill = explicit)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(
    title = "Top 50 Most Popular Tracks - The Strokes",
    x = "Track Name",
    y = "Popularity",
    fill = "Explicit"
  ) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
```

## 3.2 Duration and Popularity

**Figure 2** shows a scatterplot of track duration versus track popularity to determine if the length of the track has an influence on how popular it is, i.e., how much the users engage with it. There is a slight positive correlation between longer tracks and track popularity, illustrating that longer tracks are overall favored by listeners of The Strokes. The red line highlights the best-fit relationship between these two metrics and shows an upward trend as the length of the track increases.

```{r}
ggplot(strokes_track_details, aes(x = duration_ms / 1000, y = popularity)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.6) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, color = "red") +
  labs(
    title = "Duration vs. Popularity of Tracks",
    x = "Duration (seconds)",
    y = "Popularity"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()

# 4. Discussion

This analysis indicates that explicitness is not necessarily a predictor for song popularity as The Strokes’ top 50 songs were evenly distributed between explicit and non-explicit songs. This suggests that there is something else in the lyricism, apart from the explicitness, that drives The Strokes’ musical success.

Secondly, contrary to current trends that aim to make shorter songs to boost popularity ratings and retain user engagement, The Strokes’ top 50 songs have a slight skewness for longer songs. Further, their longer songs are outperforming shorter songs, illustrating an overall value in track content (such as musical organization and lyricism) that retains a listener’s interest for longer periods.

These findings suggest that the strength of The Strokes’ music lies not in their ability to write explicit lyrics but in their overall messaging and relatability. A user’s interest in longer tracks can be indicative of their interest in the content and messaging of the band’s music.

However, while these results are useful, it is important to note that they are extracted from only one data source and cannot account for the totality of The Strokes’ fanbase. A greater analysis needs to be conducted, pooling various data sources such as Apple Music, YouTube, online forums, and vinyl and record sales to understand the complete nature of user interest in The Strokes’ tracks.
